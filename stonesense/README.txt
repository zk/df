Welcome to Stonesense Felsite(3.1)

Thank you for trying out our little visualizer,
as always, we appreciate any feedback.

Please note that stonesense is tightly bound to DFHack, and so only works for the version that
the accompanying DFHack is built for.

To run stonesense, Copy DFHack into the dwarf fortress folder, and run DwarfFortress.exe.
When DFHack console appears, type in stonesense and press enter.
